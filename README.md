# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
Power BI Report
Objective:
To analyze workforce trends, including attrition, employee engagement, and demographic distribution, enabling HR leaders to make data-driven decisions that enhance retention, productivity, and overall workforce planning.
Action Taken:
Collected and processed HR data, including employee attrition, tenure, and demographics.
Created a dashboard to visualize key HR metrics like attrition rate, employee count, and department-wise trends.
Applied conditional logic to categorize attrition and ensure numerical data integrity.
Identified patterns in voluntary vs. involuntary attrition and analyzed the impact of tenure and age groups on retention.
Insights:
High attrition rates in specific departments or tenure groups indicate potential job dissatisfaction or career stagnation.
Employees with less than 1-2 years of experience show the highest attrition rates, suggesting onboarding or role fit issues.
Certain age groups or locations may experience higher turnover, indicating a need for targeted engagement strategies.
Patterns in employee engagement scores correlate with retention rates, highlighting the importance of workplace satisfaction initiatives.
Next Course of Action:
Implement targeted retention strategies, such as mentorship programs or career growth opportunities for employees at high risk of attrition.
Conduct exit interviews and pulse surveys to understand key drivers of turnover.
Improve onboarding programs for new employees to enhance early-stage engagement and reduce early attrition.
Introduce employee well-being and engagement initiatives, such as flexible work policies and professional development programs.
Continuously monitor and refine HR strategies based on updated dashboard insights.
